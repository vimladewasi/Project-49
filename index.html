        Origami is an ancient art form that is believed to have been around for nearly 2000 years, derived from the Japanese tradition of paper-folding.
        Though they were not the first to experiment with the culture of paper-folding, they were the first to use this technique as a style of art.
        As you can imagine, it’s had quite a lucrative history and is deeply embedded in Japanese culture.<br>
       
        <br>
        <b>Here are a few interesting things you may not have known about the origins of Origami.</b>
        <ol>
            <li>
                It wasn’t always called Origami
            </li>
            <p>
              For the initial 1500 years or so of its existence, origami was actually known as orikata, a Japanese word that translates to “Folded Paper”.
              It was in 1880 that the name of the art form was changed to origami, derived from two Japanese words; oru, meaning to fold, and kami, meaning paper.
             </p>
            <li>
                Origami was first only practiced by the Elite
            </li>
            <p>
                Paper was originally created sometime around 100 A.D.
                Paper was an expensive and rare commodity, so those engaging in the art of traditional paper folding was usually an art left for the elite rungs of society.
                Conversely, it was also used by Buddhist Monks for religious purposes. 
                It only later became a practice open to the public.
            </p>
            <li>
                It is a major part of Japanese Wedding Rituals
            </li>
            <p>
                Speaking of surprising uses, one very important function origami plays is in Japanese Wedding Rituals.
                Origami Butterflies and other simple designs are often given along with gifts and paper wrapping, but most important is the presentation of 1000 paper cranes.
            </p>
            <li>
                The first book about Origami was written in 1797
            </li>
            <p>
                
                The first book ever published about Origami was entitled “Sembazuru Orikata” (Thousand Crane Folding), and was largely about the timeless custom of folding a 1000 paper cranes for traditional weddings.
                Written by Akisato Rito, the book speaks of the legend behind the wish granted by folding this gargantuan number of cranes.
